This is a computer vision project that is able to detect the hand someone has and identify what the hand is (high card, pair, two pair, three of a kind, etc.)

Additionally, it is able to calculate the odds of you picking up other hands.

For example, if you have a pair and the river has been shown, what are the odds you pick up a three of a kind?
